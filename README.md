1. Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
- Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
- Output: [7,0,8]
- Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
5. Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.
- Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
- Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
